# Soldering-Circuit-Diagram


This is a simple program that draws you an sheet with raster dots. Output format is svg. The sheet can be used to develop circuit diagram before soldering on a board.

This C++ project gets no support at the moment. Don't ask me any questions. The short cpp file will be self-explaining.
